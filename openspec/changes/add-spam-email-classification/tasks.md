## Phase 1 - Baseline (required)

- [ ] 1.1 Download dataset from the provided URL and add provenance notes in `data/README.md`.
- [ ] 1.2 Implement `ml/preprocess.py` to load CSV, clean text, and produce train/test splits (stratified).
- [ ] 1.3 Implement `ml/train_baseline.py` to train a logistic regression classifier and save the model artifact (pickle or joblib).
- [ ] 1.4 (Optional) Implement `ml/train_svm.py` to train an SVM for comparison and record metrics.
- [ ] 1.5 Implement evaluation code to compute precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and a confusion matrix; write results to `ml/results/`.
- [ ] 1.6 Add a CLI script `tools/train_spam_baseline.py` that calls the pipeline with reproducible random seeds.
- [ ] 1.7 Add unit tests for preprocessing and a small integration test that trains on a tiny sample and verifies the evaluation outputs.
- [ ] 1.8 Document usage and reproduction steps in `ml/README.md`.
